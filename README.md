Machine Learning Internship Task 3:  Generate a Synthetic Medical Dataset.

# Task 4: 
Disease Prediction from Medical Data

# Overview

This project predicts the likelihood of diseases (e.g., heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer) from structured patient data.

# Objective

Classify patients as healthy or diseased based on medical test results.

# Approach

Features: Age, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Glucose, BMI, Symptom Score

Algorithms: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost

Datasets: Synthetic dataset (demo) + real-world datasets from UCI ML Repository

# Results

Logistic Regression: ~83% accuracy

Random Forest: ~92% accuracy

XGBoost: ~93% accuracy

# Run the Script
python disease_prediction.py
